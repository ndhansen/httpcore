AsyncHTTPTransport ( ) The base interface for sending HTTP requests. Concete implementations should subclass this class, and implement the request method, and optionally the close method. request ( self , method , url , headers=None , stream=None , timeout=None ) The interface for sending a single HTTP request, and returning a response. Parameters: method - bytes - The HTTP method, such as b'GET' . url - (bytes, bytes, int, bytes) - The URL as a 4-tuple of (scheme, host, port, path). headers - list of (bytes, bytes), optional - Any HTTP headers to send with the request. stream - bytes async iterator, optional - The body of the HTTP request. timeout - (float, float, float, float), all optional. - A tuple of timeout values for (read, write, connect, pool acquiry) operations. Returns: A five-tuple of: http_version - bytes - The HTTP version used by the server, such as b'HTTP/1.1' . status_code - int - The HTTP status code, such as 200 . reason_phrase - bytes - Any HTTP reason phrase, such as b'OK' . headers - list of (bytes, bytes) - Any HTTP headers included on the response. stream - bytes async iterator - The body of the HTTP response. close ( self ) Close the implementation, which should close any outstanding response streams, and any keep alive connections. class httpcore. AsyncByteStream ( ) The base interface for request and response bodies. Concrete implementations should subclass this class, and implement the __aiter__ method, and optionally the close method. aiter ( self ) Yield bytes representing the request or response body. close ( self ) Must be called by the client to indicate that the stream has been closed. The AsyncConnectionPool and AsyncHTTPProxy classes are concrete implementations of the AsyncHTTPTransport class. class httpcore.
